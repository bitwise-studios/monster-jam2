			Format of a dialogue element:
			speaker: the ID of the speaker
			
			body: The text to be spoken. NOTE: watch out for text boz size. 
				  If text is too long break it up into multiple <text> tags
				  You can substitute character names by wrapping the character 
				  id in $(). Remember: escaping that sequence is not implemented
				  due to time constraints and laziness.

			Example:
				<text speaker="mom">Hey $(mc) don't eat that chocolate on the table!</text>
		-->

		<text speaker="mom">Hey $(mc) don't eat that chocolate on the table!</text>
		<text speaker="dog">Woof!</text>
